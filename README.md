## Exercse from the book Visual C# How to Program

Create a Windows Form that propmts the user for survery responses and outputs each respones to a file. Use Stream-Writer to create a file called number.txt. Each integer should be written using method Write. Then add a TextBox that will output the frequency of survery resposnes. The responses should be read from the file by using a StreamReader. Class string's Split method should be used to split the input string into separate responses, then each response should be converted to an integer. The program should continue to read responses until it reaches the end of file. The results should be output to the TextBox.
